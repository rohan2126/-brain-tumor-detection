# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project uses machine learning techniques to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and is preprocessed for optimal model performance. The trained model predicts whether a tumor is present in the provided images, assisting in early detection and diagnosis. A detailed report is generated based on the model's predictions.

Key Highlights:
Dataset: Kaggle's MRI brain scans for tumor detection.
Features: Image preprocessing, classification, and report generation.
Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, scikit-learn, and data visualization libraries.
Outputs: Prediction accuracy and detailed analysis of results.

Usage:
Train the model on the dataset.
Test and validate using the provided scripts.
Use the trained model for prediction and generate diagnostic reports.
